Re: Application for the position of [junior full-stack developer] 

Dear [Company Name] Team!

I am writing to express my interest in the [Junior Full-stack developer] position that you have posted. I believe that my skills make me a strong candidate for this position.
I haven't been working as a Junior Full-stack developer, but I have experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in educational team projects. My experience includes developing adaptive websites and personal projects.
My greatest strength is the ability to self-education and I`m highly motivated and results-oriented. So I would like to thank you for your time and consideration of my CV and current portfolio projects (please find enclose). 
I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Thank you in advance!
